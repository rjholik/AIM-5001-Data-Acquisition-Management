This is my repository for the AIM-5001 Data Acquisition and Management course, offered by the Katz School of Science and Health. Throughout this course, I developed skills in SQL database design, text processing, data cleaning, dataset analysis, feature engineering, web scraping, and data management from diverse sources. The course curriculum provided me with a comprehensive understanding of working with various databases, data analysis, and several Python packages. My hands-on experience with the course's assignments and projects allowed me to develop proficiency in these skills.
